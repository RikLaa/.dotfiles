# Dotfiles
These are my personal configs for bash, zsh, tmux, git, hammerspoon and vim

## Installation
Dependencies: git, curl

See 'setup'-folder for installation scripts. 
On osx setup-brew must be run first.
Running the installation scripts nukes your previous configuration.

## VS-Code
Download syncing, setup with gist and download settings
