# .dotfiles
Configurations for vim, zsh, tmux, brew and git

# Installation

Run install.sh to bootstrap your system. 
OSX and Linux have different configurations (see scripts folder).
Only the symlink.sh is run by both systems but 
it has rules for symlinking files for the current system 
(systems might have different configurations files)

Git must be installed before running these
